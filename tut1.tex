        \item \textit{TA brief self-introduction}
        \item Attendance is not mandatory (Is ANYTHING mandatory?)
        \item Format is 25\% Concept Review, 75\% Problem Solving
        \item Focus on past exam questions of \textbf{increasing} difficulty
        \item Participation is important, this is not a lecture!

        \item Email TAs to make appointments if necessary (refer to slide 1 for tutorial TAs)
        \item Usually available for 10 minutes after tutorial
        \item Lab questions should be directed towards lab TAs

% \begin{frame}{C++ basics}
%     C is basically* (almost) a subset of C++. So anything you have previously learned in is also legal in C++...
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item variable types are fixed \texttt{int bool}
%         \item \texttt{main} is the entry point of the program \texttt{int main() {...}}
%     \end{itemize}

%     Experience with other "popular languages" such as Python is useful
% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Why C++?}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Performance... With good amount of features
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Why Not C++?}
%     (Only) 25 \% of developers use C++ (Stack Overflow Survey)
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Web Applications
%         \item Easier to get started...
%     \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Exercise \#1: There was once an interview question...}

Did you know that you can draw different shapes on the console?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Task 1: Draw a square of height X
        \item Task 2: Draw a triangle of height Y
        \item examples provided for X=5, Y=5, shown side-by-side, Taks 1 and Task 2 are independent.    % Complexity examples
        \begin{lstlisting}
        #####       #
        #####      ##
        #####     ###
        #####    ####
        #####   #####
(shown side by side for space reasons) \end{lstlisting}

\begin{frame}{Exercise \#2: How pointers were discovered when swapping numbers???}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Task A: Given integer variables foo = X, and bar = Y, how can you write a swap procedure that swaps foo and bar, such that bar = Y, foo = X
    
        \item Task B: Task A, but using a function called swap()
    
        \item Task C: Task B, but you cannot use any pointers! Can C++ do it?
        Hint: pass-by-reference
    \end{itemize}
